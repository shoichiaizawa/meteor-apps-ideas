A repository to jot down my Meteor apps ideas. No source code at this time. :sweat_smile:

For now I use this app for my Meteor app idea jotter. Any clear ideas will be sorted into a project specific repository.

Creating simple Meteor apps for people
--------------------------------------

### My encounter with Meteor, a JavaScript framework

About the end of October 2015, I came up with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), a JavaScript framework.

It was when I was watching a Japanese Node.js advocate doing one of the Meteor official tutorials while live-coding at live.nicovideo.jp.

For some reason, I was inspired by what he was doing with another JS framework with a catchy name -- Meteor! How cool is that :D

Not so long later than the day, I stared doing [one of the Meteor official tutorials](https://www.meteor.com/install) and you know what happened? I instantly fell in love with it! It was a very fun experience for me to work on the tutorial -- seeing my app going on live on the Meteor's free testing server was a truly pleasant experience.

The official tutorial offers three simple todo apps, the first one which I did only requires basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript as a scaffold. The second one and the third one are also simple todo apps but you create apps combining AngularJS and React -- I will do these two tutorials once I find my spare time slot.

As of November 2015, I still do not know how to write HTML/CSS nor any programming language properly, but this Meteor thing and its [amazingly helpful package community](https://atmospherejs.com/) gave me a lot of encouragement to create something by myself from nothing.

### Now I want to create my first application using Meteor

So now what? I am thinking about making a web application using Meteor.

Thankfully, I came up with some chances which I may be able to apply this technology. Since I am an absolute beginner, obviously the learning curve will be very steep and not sure if this is manageable with my current skill levels. But within a month, hopefully by the end of 2015, I will try to approach the solution as hard as I can.

### Here are my rough ideas for two Meteor apps:

1. **A simple bingo game app**
    - This may be helpful to my gym mates at an end-of-year party
    - This app may not be necessary but I would like to challenge myself to create a simple bingo game app that can be used for the game to win a present
    - Details to be added
2. **A topic generator app**
    - This app is to help out participants of a language exchange meetup
    - An app inspired by [TableTopicsÂ®](http://www.tabletopics.com/)
    - The organiser of the language exchange group often thinks it would be nice to offer an app like this to save people at each table from not being able to find topics to talk about
    - details to be added

### I created a GitHub Issue for each app:
